## Ice Ice Breaker

![](../img/extra/orientation/zero/ice.jpg)



## Expectations Icebreaker
### Think/pair/share
---

**Think**

- Take 2 mins to independently answer this question about your expectations for the class:

  *What will it look like for you to walk out of here feeling like you got great value out of this course?*


## Expectations Icebreaker

### Think/Pair/Share
---
**Pair**

- Take 2 mins to pair with your neighbor and discuss what you came up with


## Expectations Icebreaker
### Think/Pair/Share
---
**Share**

- Let's review some of them


  **Expectations/Logistics**
---
### Content

- In FEWD, our focus will be primarily on what the front end experience looks (and feels) like

  - We will also be looking at some introductory programming concepts by way of incorporating user-interactivity into our sites using JavaScript (JS)

    - We will not be covering **everything you need to know** to **build any site** you can imagine


## Homework Basics
---

- There will be 8 assignments in the course

- There will be one a week starting next week

- The assignment schedule is available in the **Class Repo** (what's that?)

- Suggest you budget 3-5 hours for each assignment and additional time for readings




### Homework assessment
---
- For assignments submitted on time, you can expect **qualitative** and **quantitative** feedback from me by the following class

- Qualitative will include written comments in your code, via GitHub

- Quantitative will be based off of a rubric for that assignment, also via GitHub

- Sample solutions will typically be posted on the day feedback is returned



### Homework assessment
---
Example Rubric (quantitative)

![Screen Shot 2016-04-17 at 9.07.23 PM](../img/extra/rubric.png)


## Final Project
---
- 5 milestones including the presentation itself
- Milestones begin in unit 5
- Schedule is in the class repo
- The project specs will be posted on Monday of next week so you can start to think about ideas


### Resources

- Relevant reading/resources for each new unit will typically be available in the class repo the day following the preceding class

- Most lessons will have slides/markdown, and these will be available in the class repo by the following day

- I don't want to discourage you from taking notes, but most of the important concepts for this course will be included in the slides


## Resources (cont'd)

- Don't be afraid to use Google!  Every developer I know does.

- Help each other (group Slack channel)



## Expectations Icebreaker (con't)
---
- Let's take 3 minutes

- Go ahead and update yours if they have changed after hearing others'

- Flip the card and on the back I want you to quantify this.  How will you know your goal has been met?
---
- e.g. if your expectation was "want to be a Front-end developer", what does that look like?  How will you measure that?  

  *example:  I want to have built a site that I built from scratch that has animation on it*


## Expectations Icebreaker
---
How are you going to achieve this?

---
- List out some ways you will work to achieve your goal

- Date, sign it, and either hand it in or take a picture and practice using Slack and send it my way after class

*e.g.*...
- *I will attend all classes that I am able to*
  - *I will make use of office hours, particularly if I"m having trouble with certain concepts*


## Communication

**Slack is a messaging app.**  

![slack](../img/extra/slack.png)
=


## Slack

Our primary means of communication (other than GitHub)

---

- Group Chat (fewd-sm-29)

  - in-class info (code snippets, links etc.)

  - info on GA events

  - place for you guys to interact

- Private Messages
  - good place to communicate with myself and your classmates

  - good way to communicate with each other


## Slack

   1. Who has the app?
   2. Is everybody in the channel?

## Sublime Text
---
Now, we are going to review...

- Setting up a work environment for FEWD
- Practice creating folders in Sublime
- Practice creating files in Sublime



## Sublime Text
### Environment setup - workspace folder
****
1. In the finder, create a folder called *FEWD* on your *desktop*
2. Open up Sublime Text
3. File -> open
4. Navigate into this new *FEWD* folder and click *open*
5. Press *ctrl + mouse click* on the main folder
6. Select the option to create a new folder, label it *workspace*, and press return
7. Click Project -> Save Project As and replace *untitled* with *fewd*. Save this in the *FEWD* folder you created. Two new files should appear in your file list
8. Quit Sublime Text
9. Double-click on your project file which should now be in your *FEWD* folder


## Sublime Text
### Environment setup  - creating files
****

1. ctrl + mouse click on your  workspace folder, and click *New File*
2. *file->save* **or** *cmd+s* to save this file.  
   1. When prompted, call it *test.html*

3. Quit Sublime text
4. Open Sublime from your project file in your *FEWD* folder again




### Sublime Text | Activity

****
Take 3 minutes to:
1. create a folder in your workspace folder called *intro*

   In the *intro* folder, **create three new files**.  The filenames should be the answers to the following questions:

2. What is your first name?

3. What is one band or musician you like?

4. What is one food you like?

Examples:  *barry.html*, *ray-charles.html* or *ice-cream.html*



## Learning Objectives | GitHub Review
---

- Define a version control system (Git) and explain its benefits
- Using the GitHub desktop app, you will be able to:

  - Clone an existing remote repository (repo) & initialize a local version of it on your computer

  - Pull changes from a remote repo
  - Commit your changes locally

  - Push locally commited changes to a remote repo


### ACTIVITY: Stop & Jot
As part of the pre-work setting up your first repo, you learned a bit about Git & GitHub

------

*take 3 mins to brainstorm answers to the following questions* *on your desk*
- What is Git?
- What is GitHub?
- What are some benefits to using it?
- What are some keywords you remember?



## Git/GitHub
### What is git?
---
* **<u>git</u>** - a version control program that saves the state of your project's files and folders...like a snapshot

* **<u>repository</u>** - a central location in which data (usually a project) is stored and managed

* **<u>clone</u>** - a copy of data from the cloud to your local machine (laptop, computer, etc.)

* **<u>commit</u>**
  - *noun* - a particular snapshot
  - *verb* - taking a snapshot

## Git/GitHub | What is GitHub?
---

* **GitHub** is a platform that makes it easy to manage git ***repositories***. It is now commonplace in any company that works with engineers.

* Just like Dropbox or Google Drive, **GitHub** stores files online and allows people to share them

* **Github** is based on the Git version control system - easily allowing engineers to work on the same project.


## Git/GitHub | What is GitHub?

![](../img/extra/orientation/zero/simple.png)


## Git/GitHub | What's the point?
---
-  Developers can work **collaboratively**, **asynchronously** and **have a history** of their code

   - Multiple developers can work on the same project

   - GitHub **tracks changes** so you can see who worked on what.

   - Since GitHub stores a history of the code, **developers can go back in time** if something breaks
-  GitHub allows for **feedback to be given** on the code, which hopefully, **increases code quality** (like track changes in Word)


## Git/GitHub | How will  <u>we</u> be using them?
---
*   In this class, <u>you</u> will be using it to:

    *   pull (download) files from the class repo

    *   create repos for your assignments, commit your changes to them and send me the link when you are ready to submit
    *   receive qualitative feedback on assignments/final project

    *   receive quantitative feedback on your assignments/project

    *   communicate with me regarding the feedback


## Pulling from Class Repo
![](../img/extra/orientation/zero/git_in_class.png)


## Creating your own repos
### (assignments, projects)

![](../img/extra/orientation/zero/git_general_diagram.png)


## Git/GitHub
### How will  <u>we</u> be using git?
---
*   I will primarily be using it to:

    *   Add resources to the class repo
    *   Provide starter code for in-class activities & assignments
    *   Review and provide feedback on your assignments


### Git/GitHub agenda

**Create a repository on GitHub and clone it to our local machine** <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

- practice pushing from local to remote <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

*This replicates the assignment creation and submission process* <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

---

**Clone a copy of the class repo to your local machine** <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

- practice pulling from remote <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
- practice copying files from your local class repo, to your local workspace <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

*This replicates the regular start-of-class sync process* <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->


### Creating and cloning a repo

**Now, we are going to create a repository on GitHub, and clone it to our local machine**

1. Login GitHub.com, press the big green button for "New Repository" <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

2. Name your repository "cookie_recipe" <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

3. Click on the "setup in desktop" button to clone the repo to your local machine <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

4. Your GitHub app should open with a message that says, "clone as" with the name of your new repo<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

5. Save the repo inside of your "FEWD" class folder from earlier <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->



**Your *FEWD* folder should look like this**

```
     - FEWD/
      - workspace
      - cookie_recipe (sample repository)
      - fewd.sublime-project
      - fewd.sublime-workspace
```


### Creating and cloning a repo

#### Adding/committing/pushing files

---

- Navigate to this folder in Sublime Text <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
- Add a new file to the "cookie_recipe" folder (from within Sublime) <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
- Notice any changes in your GitHub Desktop App? <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->



### Creating and cloning a repo

#### Adding / committing / pushing files
---
- I'm going to Slack out a .zip file to you

- Download and extract the file

- Copy the contents into the *cookie_recipe* folder that is in your *FEWD* folder

  - only copy in the files, not the folder itself




### Creating and cloning a repo
#### Committing & pushing changes

---

1. Go back to the GitHub app and select the "Changes" tab<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

2. Select all files, enter a commit message, and hit commit <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->
   - For future projects, you will want to <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->**commit frequently**<!-- .element: class="fragment"--> and will typically detail what the change or feature is the commit message<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

3. After committing, click the <!-- .element: class="fragment"-->*publish* button.<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->

4. Go back to GitHub.com and refresh your repository page. You should now see the cookie recipe's files inside.<!-- .element: class="fragment"-->


## Git/GitHub | class repo
#### Cloning and working with the class repo

****

You've just *created*, *cloned* and *pushed* to a *remote repo*.  

Now, we'll go through the process of *cloning an existing repo * & working with those files

* this is how you will receive **files** and code **from** me


## Git/GitHub | class repo
#### Cloning and working with the class repo

---

Using the same process that you just did to ***clone*** your own repo, go ahead and **clone the class repo** into your `fewd` folder


**Your folder/file structure should look like this** **after cloning it**

```
     - FEWD/
     - workspace
      - cookie_recipe (sample repository)
      - fewd.sublime-project
      - fewd.sublime-workspace
      - fewd_sm_29/ (class repo)
```


### GitHub | class repo pulling & copying
---
- The class repo is where and how I will distribute most files in the class  
  - starter code for labs and assignments
  - solution code for in-class activities, as well as assignments

- The class repo is a one-way channel.

- You will be doing your work in your *workspace* folder (you created earlier)


**Your folder/file structure should now look like this**

```
- FEWD/
  - workspace (where you will do your work for this class)
  - cookie_recipe (sample repository)
  - fewd.sublime-project
  - fewd.sublime-workspace
  - fewd_sm_29/ (class repo - where you will receive files)
```


### GitHub Routine | every class
---
1. Sync your local version of the class repo, with the master version when you get to class

2. Copy the new material to your *workspace* folder

3. Work from inside your workspace folder!


### GitHub Routine | every class
---
**I'm going to push a folder to the class repo**
1. Navigate to the class repo in GitHub app, and click *sync* to get the latest from the class repo.  
   - This will update the folder on your computer with the latest code

   - check for a new folder in Sublime

2. Copy the new material *Week_01_Basics* to your *workspace* folder in `finder` and look at your file tree in Sublime

**Your folder/file structure should look like this**

```
     - FEWD/
      - cookie_recipe (sample repository)
      - fewd.sublime-project
      - fewd.sublime-workspace
      - fewd_sm_29/ (class repo)
      - workspace/
         - Week_01_Basics
           - 01_html_basics
             - ga_press_release
             - fewd_outline
```


### GitHub Workflow | feedback/grading
---
*  I will use it to post sample code/solutions and review/assess your work via:

   * qualitative feedback using inline comments and
   * quantitative using a rubric

### GitHub Workflow | assignment submission
---
* Depending on the assignment, you will either create a new repository with the project name or contribute to an existing repo.

* You should commit all of your files when they are ready for review

* After publishing, please slack me a link to your repository


### GitHub Workflow | practice homework submission
---
**Take 5-7 minutes to do the following**

1. Create new repository called *homework-portfolio* on GitHub

2. Clone it into  your `Week_01_Basics` folder in your  *workspace* folder

3. In Sublime Text, Create a file called *index.html* with some text on it

4. Save the file in Sublime text

5. Commit the file in GitHub Desktop App

6. Publish the file

7. Refresh your repo online to ensure it was uploaded!


### GitHub Workflow | Qualitative assignment feedback

### GitHub Workflow - Quantitative assignment feedback
---
![](../img/extra/rubric.png)


### GitHub Workflow | Quantitative assignment feedback
---
* If the assignment has been completed

* If it has, each assignment has various technical requirements

    *  2 points when a technical requirement exceeds expectations
    *  1 point when a technical requirement  meets expectations (this is normal)
    *  0 points when a technical requirement  does not meet expectations

You will be notified via email of a *new issue* once our feedback has been submitted
