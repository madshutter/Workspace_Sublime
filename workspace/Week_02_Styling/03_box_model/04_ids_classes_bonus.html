  1. use an element selector to make the background of <body> gray
  1. use an element selector to
    - make all <div>s 200px x 100px (width x height)
    - make all <div>s have a default background color of white
  2. assign an id of "box1" to one <div>
  3. assign an id of "box2" to another one
  4. using a class, make exactly two <div>s have a 5px dotted border that is orange
  5. utilizing the id you've created, make #box1 have a green background
  6. utilizing the id you've created, make #box2 have a blue background

  BONUS:
  - Assign the <div>s that are not part of the "box" class, to be part of the "round" class
  - Create a .round rule that uses border-radius: and width: to make them appear as circles
  - Now, achieve the same effect by targeting those <div>s using the :not selector, instead of the .round class
